# LoginPage-Bootstrap
Simple login page using Twitter-Bootstrap framework

You can run it using this link:
https://rawgit.com/Gerfier/LoginPage-Bootstrap/master/index.html


//This project was created using Bootstrap framework (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
The javascript file contains testing user info.
Has a saved "username,email, password" that if entered correctly will promt a success message otherwise and error message.
*username: gerardfierro
*email: gerard@gmail.com
*password: gerardfierro

All files are needed to work correctly on the browser.
//A sign up page will be added later so this will be updated.

I used the following links to understand the code but then extended based on the learned material as you can see on my files.
