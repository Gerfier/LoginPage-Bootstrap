# LoginPage-Bootstrap
Simple login page using Twitter-Bootstrap framework

//This project was created using Bootstrap framework (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
All files are needed to work correctly on the browser.
//A sign up page will be added later so this will be updated.

I used the following links to understand the code but then extended based on the learned material as you can see on my files.
